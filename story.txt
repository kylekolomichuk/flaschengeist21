After a long drive to Raesfeld my hund, the wired labradoodle, chased after the Baeckerei and to my suprise I got free bread.
Professor Mehlhase works at ASU.
My father enjoys a nice view and a bowl of cereal in his Audi.
He also enjoys brot with breakfast.
I wonder if ASU pays professors enough for them to own a Porche?
I wish COVID didn't keep me from going to the local biergarten.
I would also love visiting a ratskeller one day, but due to my klimaanlage breaking and needing repairs, I don't have the funds.
I couldnt believe it the Flughafen has a Biergarten I was so exited I listened to RammsteinMusik.
I lost my hund in Munich!
I know what I now need, a delicious Gebaeck!
So I made my way to the store, but there was a Schloss on the door!
And on that schloss, in the window, was a dirndel holding a mehlhase named Pepper.
